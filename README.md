The HTML form includes input fields for Name, Email address, Phone number, Gender, and Password, as well as a submit button.
The form includes some basic styling to make it look nicer.
The required attribute is added to each input field so that the browser will automatically check if the field is empty when the form is submitted.
The onsubmit attribute is added to the form tag, which calls the validateForm() function when the form is submitted.
The validateForm() function gets the values of each input field, checks if any are empty, highlights any empty fields with a red border, and displays an error message if the email address is not in the correct format.
If there are no errors, the validateForm() function displays a success message and returns true, which submits the form.
The error message and success message are displayed using two div elements with classes error and success, respectively.
